### Test 4: Analysis with Single Connection ‚úÖ NEW BEHAVIOR
```
1. Ensure MT5 connected
2. Set symbols: GBPUSD, EURUSD, XAUUSD
3. Click "Run Analysis"
4. Watch logs carefully

Expected log:
üöÄ Starting full analysis cycle...

üì° Connecting to MT5...          (Only if not already connected)
‚úÖ Connected to MT5

üîç Processing GBPUSD...
Fetching GBPUSD H4 from MT5...
‚úÖ Successfully fetched 1000 bars from MT5

üîç Processing EURUSD...
Fetching EURUSD H4 from MT5...   (No reconnection attempt!)
‚úÖ Successfully fetched 1000 bars from MT5

üîç Processing XAUUSD...
Fetching XAUUSD H4 from MT5...   (No reconnection attempt!)
‚úÖ Successfully fetched 1000 bars from MT5

‚úÖ Full cycle completed!

Should NOT see:
‚ùå "MT5 not connected, attempting to connect..." (multiple times)
‚ùå Multiple connection attempts per symbol
‚ùå Redundant initialization messages
```

**Result:** [ ] PASS  [ ] FAIL

**Connection Attempts Logged:** _____

---

### Test 5: Connection Failure Handling ‚úÖ FAIL FAST
```
1. Ensure MT5 is NOT connected (or stop MT5 terminal)
2. Click "Run Analysis"
3. Observe behavior

Expected:
üì° Connecting to MT5...
‚ùå Cannot proceed: MT5 connection failed and no fallback data source available
Analysis aborted

Should NOT:
‚ùå Try to analyze each symbol individually
‚ùå Multiple error messages per symbol
‚ùå Confusing error output
```

**Result:** [ ] PASS  [ ] FAIL

**Error Message Clear?:** [ ] YES  [ ] NO

---

### Test 6: Partial Symbol Failure ‚úÖ GOOD RECOVERY
```
1. Connect to MT5
2. Set symbols: GBPUSD, INVALIDSYMBOL, XAUUSD
3. Run analysis

Expected:
üîç Processing GBPUSD...
‚úÖ GBPUSD processed successfully

üîç Processing INVALIDSYMBOL...
‚ùå Error processing INVALIDSYMBOL: Symbol not found

üîç Processing XAUUSD...
‚úÖ XAUUSD processed successfully

Summary:
‚úÖ Processed: 2
‚ùå Failed: 1

Should:
‚úÖ Continue with valid symbols
‚úÖ Log clear error for invalid symbol
‚úÖ Complete analysis for other symbols
```

**Result:** [ ] PASS  [ ] FAIL

---

### Test 7: Performance Check
```
1. Connect to MT5
2. Run analysis on 3 symbols
3. Note the time taken

Connection time: _____ seconds
Total analysis time: _____ seconds
Time per symbol: _____ seconds

Compare with before (if known):
Before: _____ seconds total
After: _____ seconds total
Improvement: _____ %
```

**Result:** [ ] FASTER  [ ] SAME  [ ] SLOWER

---

### Test 8: Log Clarity
```
Review the connection log file:
logs/mt5_connection_YYYYMMDD_HHMMSS.log

Check for:
‚úì Clear connection flow (not excessive)
‚úì Readable error messages
‚úì No Unicode encoding errors
‚úì Proper UTF-8 characters display
‚úì Actionable error messages

Sample good error:
"MT5 initialization failed
Error: (1, 'Terminal not found')
Steps to fix:
1. Ensure MT5 terminal is installed and running..."

Sample bad error:
"Error: (1, 'Terminal not found')"
(no context, no fix steps)
```

**Log Quality:** [ ] EXCELLENT  [ ] GOOD  [ ] NEEDS WORK

---

### Test 9: Results Verification
```
After successful analysis:

1. Check Excel file: sentiment_log.xlsx
   ‚úì File created/updated?
   ‚úì Data populated correctly?
   ‚úì Timestamps correct?

2. Check GUI display:
   ‚úì Results shown clearly?
   ‚úì Sentiment bias displayed?
   ‚úì Confidence levels shown?

3. Check reports (if generated):
   ‚úì PDF report created?
   ‚úì Charts generated?
   ‚úì Data accurate?
```

**Result:** [ ] PASS  [ ] FAIL

---

### Test 10: Resource Cleanup
```
1. Run analysis
2. Close GUI
3. Check Task Manager / Activity Monitor

Expected:
‚úì Python process terminates cleanly
‚úì No orphaned MT5 connections
‚úì No memory leaks
‚úì Clean shutdown logs
```

**Result:** [ ] PASS  [ ] FAIL
