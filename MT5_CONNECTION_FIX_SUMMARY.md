# MT5 Connection Fix - Summary

## What Was Fixed

I've improved the MT5 connection handling to address the "stuck on connecting" issue you were experiencing. Here's what changed:

### 1. **Better Error Messages** (`data_manager.py`)
   - Added detailed error messages with troubleshooting steps
   - Connection failures now show exactly what went wrong
   - Added MT5 terminal process detection (checks if MT5.exe is running)

### 2. **Improved GUI** (`gui.py`)
   - Added comprehensive troubleshooting section in the MT5 connection card
   - Better error display when connection fails
   - Added expandable troubleshooting guide in the UI

### 3. **Diagnostic Tools**
   - Created `test_mt5_diagnostics.py` - Run this to diagnose connection issues
   - Created `TROUBLESHOOT_MT5_CONNECTION.md` - Complete troubleshooting guide

### 4. **Dependencies** (`requirements.txt`)
   - Added `psutil` for process monitoring
   - Added `streamlit` to requirements

## How to Fix Your Connection Issue

Since your connection was working before but now gets stuck on "connecting", try these steps:

### Quick Fix (Most Common Solution)

```cmd
1. Close MetaTrader 5 completely
2. Wait 10 seconds
3. Open MetaTrader 5 again
4. Login manually in MT5
5. Try connecting from your application again
```

### Run Diagnostics

To find out exactly what's wrong:

```cmd
python test_mt5_diagnostics.py
```

This will tell you:
- ‚úÖ Is MT5 terminal running?
- ‚úÖ Is MetaTrader5 module installed?
- ‚úÖ Can it connect?
- ‚ùå What's the exact error?

### Check the GUI

When you click "Connect MT5" in the GUI:
1. It will show detailed error messages if it fails
2. Click the **"üîß Troubleshooting"** section in the MT5 card
3. Follow the steps listed there

## Common Causes When It Worked Before

### 1. MT5 Terminal Not Running
**Symptom**: "MT5 terminal does not appear to be running"
**Fix**: Start MT5 and login

### 2. MT5 Needs Restart
**Symptom**: Initialization fails with generic error
**Fix**: Close MT5 completely (check Task Manager), wait, restart

### 3. Algo Trading Disabled
**Symptom**: Connection fails even though MT5 is running
**Fix**: 
- In MT5: Tools ‚Üí Options ‚Üí Expert Advisors
- Enable "Allow automated trading"
- Enable "Allow DLL imports"

### 4. MT5 Auto-Updated
**Symptom**: Worked yesterday, fails today
**Fix**: Restart MT5 after updates

### 5. Connection Session Expired
**Symptom**: MT5 shows you're logged in but connection fails
**Fix**: Logout and login again in MT5

## What to Check

Run through this checklist:

- [ ] MetaTrader 5 terminal is open
- [ ] You're logged into MT5 (can see account balance)
- [ ] "Algo Trading" button in MT5 toolbar is enabled (green)
- [ ] Expert Advisors are allowed (Tools ‚Üí Options ‚Üí Expert Advisors)
- [ ] Your credentials are correct:
  - Login: 211744072 (or your account)
  - Server: ExnessKE-MT5Trial9 (or your server)
- [ ] MT5 terminal hasn't been updated recently (might need restart)

## Prevention

To avoid this issue in the future:

1. **Keep MT5 Running**: Don't close MT5 while using the application
2. **Stay Logged In**: Make sure MT5 is logged in before connecting
3. **Restart Regularly**: Restart MT5 if you haven't used it in a while
4. **After Updates**: Restart MT5 after any MT5 updates

## Still Not Working?

If you've tried everything:

1. Check the **Status Monitor** tab in the GUI for detailed logs
2. Look for error messages in the console/terminal
3. Run the diagnostic script: `python test_mt5_diagnostics.py`
4. Check `TROUBLESHOOT_MT5_CONNECTION.md` for advanced troubleshooting
5. Try Yahoo Finance as a fallback (it's automatic if MT5 fails)

## Files Changed

- `data_manager.py` - Improved connection handling and error messages
- `gui.py` - Added troubleshooting UI and better error display  
- `requirements.txt` - Added psutil and streamlit
- `test_mt5_diagnostics.py` - NEW: Diagnostic tool
- `TROUBLESHOOT_MT5_CONNECTION.md` - NEW: Troubleshooting guide

## Next Steps

1. Run `python test_mt5_diagnostics.py` to see what's wrong

3. Check the troubleshooting guide if needed
4. Let me know what the diagnostic tool reports!
