# Status Monitor & Data Column Fix Summary

## Issues Fixed

### 1. Missing 'close' Column Error
**Problem:** DataFrames returned from MT5 were missing required columns ('close', 'open', etc.)

**Root Causes:**
- Corrupted cache files missing the 'time' column
- Inadequate validation of DataFrame structure after fetching
- Column selection logic in `_mt5_df_from_rates` wasn't preserving required columns

**Solutions:**
1. **Improved `_mt5_df_from_rates` function** (data_manager.py):
   - Added explicit validation for all required columns (open, high, low, close, tick_volume)
   - Better error logging to identify missing columns early
   - Fixed column selection to preserve all required columns before setting index
   - Added debug logging to track DataFrame structure

2. **Added DataFrame validation** (dashboard.py):
   - New `_validate_dataframe_structure()` method to check DataFrames before processing
   - Validates presence of required columns, numeric data types, and non-empty data
   - Better error messages showing what columns are missing vs. available

3. **Enhanced error handling** (dashboard.py):
   - Added fallback values if indicators can't be calculated
   - More defensive checks for column existence
   - Better logging of DataFrame structure at each step

4. **Cache cleanup**:
   - Deleted corrupted cache files that were missing 'time' column
   - Fresh data will be fetched from MT5 and cached correctly

### 2. Status Monitor Implementation
**New Feature:** Real-time application status monitoring

**What Was Added:**

1. **status_monitor.py** - New module:
   - Thread-safe singleton monitoring system
   - Tracks 8 event types: Info, Success, Warning, Error, Data Fetch, Analysis, Connection, Cache
   - Stores last 500 events with timestamps
   - Provides statistics on all activities

2. **Integration into core modules**:
   - **dashboard.py**: Logs analysis cycles, symbol processing, successes, failures
   - **data_manager.py**: Tracks MT5 connections, data fetches, retries, errors

3. **New Status Monitor Tab in GUI** (gui.py):
   - Real-time event log with auto-refresh (every 1 second)
   - Activity statistics dashboard
   - Event filtering by type
   - Configurable event count (10-500)
   - Clear log button
   - Table and text view modes

## How to Use

### For the Column Error Fix:
1. **No action needed** - the corrupted cache has been cleared
2. When you run the analysis next time, fresh data will be fetched and validated
3. Watch for the new validation messages in the logs showing DataFrame structure

### For the Status Monitor:
1. Launch the GUI: `streamlit run gui.py`
2. Go to the **"ðŸ“Š Status Monitor"** tab
3. Enable **"ðŸ”„ Auto-refresh"** checkbox to see live updates
4. Watch real-time logs of:
   - MT5 connection attempts and status
   - Data fetches from MT5 or Yahoo Finance
   - Analysis operations starting and completing
   - Successes, failures, and warnings
   - All application activities

## Validation Points Added

### In data_manager.py:
- âœ… Validates MT5 rates have all required columns before creating DataFrame
- âœ… Logs detailed column information for debugging
- âœ… Returns properly structured DataFrames with named index
- âœ… Logs all connection events, data fetches, and errors to status monitor

### In dashboard.py:
- âœ… Validates DataFrame structure before processing
- âœ… Checks for required columns (open, high, low, close)
- âœ… Verifies data types are numeric
- âœ… Provides detailed feedback on what's missing
- âœ… Logs all analysis operations to status monitor

## Testing

To verify the fixes work:

1. **Clear cache** (already done): `rm -f data/*.csv`
2. **Run analysis** from the GUI
3. **Check logs** for:
   - "DataFrame columns: [...]" - should show open, high, low, close, tick_volume
   - "âœ… All required columns present"
   - No more "KeyError: 'close'" errors

4. **Monitor status** in the Status Monitor tab:
   - Should see "Fetching GBPUSD D1 from MT5"
   - Should see "Fetched X bars for GBPUSD D1 from MT5"
   - All operations logged in real-time

## Key Improvements

1. **Better Error Messages**: You'll now see exactly what's wrong with the data
2. **Real-time Monitoring**: Know what the application is doing every second
3. **Defensive Programming**: Multiple validation layers prevent crashes
4. **Detailed Logging**: Easy to debug issues by checking Status Monitor
5. **Graceful Degradation**: System continues even if some operations fail

## Files Modified

1. `status_monitor.py` - **NEW** - Status monitoring system
2. `data_manager.py` - Enhanced validation, status logging, fixed column handling
3. `dashboard.py` - Added validation, status logging, better error handling
4. `gui.py` - Added Status Monitor tab with real-time updates
5. `data/*.csv` - **DELETED** - Corrupted cache files removed

## Next Steps

The application should now:
- âœ… Fetch data correctly from MT5 with all required columns
- âœ… Show you exactly what's happening in real-time
- âœ… Provide clear error messages if something goes wrong
- âœ… Continue running even if individual operations fail
- âœ… Reset status log on cache clear or new run

Run an analysis and check the Status Monitor tab to see it in action!
