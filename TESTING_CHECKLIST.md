- [ ] Option 2: Runs command line analysis
- [ ] Option 3: Shows system check
- [ ] Option 4: Installs dependencies
- [ ] Option 5: Opens reports folder
- [ ] Option 6: Shows system information
- [ ] Option 7: Exits cleanly

#### check_system.bat
- [ ] Shows Python version
- [ ] Lists all core files
- [ ] Checks Python packages
- [ ] Reports installed versions
