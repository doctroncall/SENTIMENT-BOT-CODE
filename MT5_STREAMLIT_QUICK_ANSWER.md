# 🔌 Quick Answer: Streamlit + Local MT5

## Will it work? **YES!** ✅

Streamlit **CAN** work with locally installed MT5 because:

```
┌────────────────────────────────────────┐
│      YOUR COMPUTER                     │
│                                        │
│  Browser ──► Streamlit ──► MT5        │
│  (UI)        (Python)     (Terminal)  │
│                                        │
│  All three run on the same machine!   │
└────────────────────────────────────────┘
```

## How Data Flows

```
1. You click "Run Analysis" in Streamlit GUI
                    ↓
2. Streamlit Python code executes
                    ↓
3. Python calls: mt5.copy_rates_range()
                    ↓
4. MT5 library connects to running MT5 terminal
                    ↓
5. MT5 terminal fetches data from broker
                    ↓
6. Data returns through the chain to Streamlit
                    ↓
7. GUI displays results
```

## Requirements ✅

- ✅ MT5 terminal **installed** on your machine
- ✅ MT5 terminal **running** (doesn't need to be focused)
- ✅ Run Streamlit **locally**: `streamlit run gui.py`
- ✅ Access via **localhost:8501** in browser

## Testing Your Setup

Run this test script:
```bash
python test_mt5_connection.py
```

It will verify:
1. ✅ MT5 package installed
2. ✅ MT5 terminal accessible
3. ✅ Connection working
4. ✅ Data can be fetched
5. ✅ Streamlit compatibility

## Common Issues & Solutions

### Issue: "MT5 initialize failed"
**Solution**: Make sure MT5 terminal is running!

### Issue: "Login failed"
**Solution**: Login through MT5 GUI first, then try Streamlit

### Issue: "No data available"
**Solution**: Check symbol is available from your broker

## Smart Fallbacks 🛡️

Your system already has fallbacks:
```
Try MT5 → Fail → Try Yahoo Finance → Fail → Synthetic Data
```

Enable in Streamlit sidebar:
```
☑ Allow synthetic fallback
```

## When It WON'T Work ❌

- ❌ Streamlit deployed to cloud/remote server
- ❌ MT5 on one machine, Streamlit on another
- ❌ MT5 terminal not running

## Your Setup Status

Based on your code:
- ✅ Correctly configured for local use
- ✅ Has MT5 path: `C:\Program Files\MetaTrader 5\terminal64.exe`
- ✅ Has credentials from environment variables
- ✅ Has fallback to Yahoo Finance
- ✅ GUI shows connection status clearly

## Next Steps

1. **Ensure MT5 is running**
   ```
   Check taskbar → MT5 icon should be visible
   ```

2. **Run Streamlit**
   ```bash
   streamlit run gui.py
   ```

3. **Check connection**
   ```
   Top of dashboard should show:
   🟢 MT5 Status: Connected
   ```

4. **If not connected**
   ```
   Click: [🔌 Connect MT5]
   ```

## Bottom Line

**Your setup will work perfectly for local development!** 🚀

The only requirement is that MT5 terminal is running on the same machine where you run Streamlit.
