# 🚀 Quick Start - SMC System (5-Minute Setup)

**Your production-grade SMC trading bot is ready!**

---

## ✅ Pre-Flight Checklist

Before you start, verify these files exist:

```bash
# Core SMC system
ls core/smc_components.py      # ✅ Should exist
ls core/bias_calculator.py     # ✅ Should exist
ls core/smc_engine.py           # ✅ Should exist
ls core/__init__.py             # ✅ Should exist

# Configuration
ls config/smc_config.yaml       # ✅ Should exist

# Updated dashboard
ls dashboard_smc.py             # ✅ Should exist
```

If any file is missing, **stop** and check the file delivery.

## 🔧 Step 1: Install Dependency (30 seconds)

```bash
pip install pyyaml
```

**Verify:**
```bash
python -c "import yaml; print('✅ Ready!')"
```

---

## 🧪 Step 2: Test Core System (2 minutes)

```bash
# Test all components
python core/smc_components.py && \
python core/bias_calculator.py && \
python core/smc_engine.py

# Expected: Three ✅ messages
```

**If tests fail:** Check Python version (need 3.8+) and dependencies

---

## 🎯 Step 3: Test Dashboard (1 minute)

```bash
python dashboard_smc.py
```

**Expected output:**
```
======================================================================
✅ Dashboard Initialized (SMC System)
======================================================================
Symbols: GBPUSD, XAUUSD
Timeframes: D1, H4, H1
Excel Log: smc_analysis_log.xlsx
SMC Engine: Ready
======================================================================
```

**If this works, you're 90% done!**

---

## 🖥️ Step 4: Update GUI (1 minute)

Open `gui.py` and find this line (around line 24):

```python
from dashboard import Dashboard
```

Change to:

```python
from dashboard_smc import Dashboard
```

**Save the file.**

---

## 🚀 Step 5: Launch! (30 seconds)

```bash
streamlit run gui.py
```

**In the GUI:**
1. Go to **Home** tab
2. Click **"Run Full Analysis"**
3. Go to **Analysis** tab
4. See your SMC results! 🎉

---

## 📊 What You Should See

### In Terminal:
```
==================================================
SMC Analysis: GBPUSD
==================================================

📊 Fetching data...
✅ Data collected: ['D1', 'H4', 'H1']

🔍 Running SMC analysis...
   Order Blocks: 3 (2 bullish, 1 bearish)
   Market Structure: BULLISH (strength=75)
   Fair Value Gaps: 2 (both bullish)

✅ SMC ANALYSIS COMPLETE
Bias: BULLISH
Confidence: 68.5%
Level: MEDIUM
```

### In GUI (Analysis Tab):
| Date | Symbol | Bias | Confidence | Level | Bullish | Bearish | Signals |
|------|--------|------|------------|-------|---------|---------|---------|
| 2025-10-20 | GBPUSD | BULLISH | 68.5 | MEDIUM | 68.5 | 31.5 | 9 |

## ✅ Success Criteria

You know it's working if:

- [x] Dashboard initializes without errors
- [x] MT5 connects successfully  
- [x] Analysis completes in <10 seconds
- [x] Results appear in Analysis tab
- [x] Excel file is created/updated
- [x] Bias is clear (BULLISH/BEARISH/NEUTRAL)
- [x] Confidence makes sense (0-100%)

---

## 🐛 Troubleshooting (if needed)

### "ModuleNotFoundError: No module named 'core'"

**Solution:** Make sure you're running from the project root directory.

```bash
cd /path/to/trading_bot
python dashboard_smc.py
```

### "ModuleNotFoundError: No module named 'yaml'"

**Solution:**
```bash
pip install pyyaml
```

### "FileNotFoundError: config/smc_config.yaml"

**Solution:**
```bash
mkdir -p config
# Config file should have been created. Check if it exists.
ls config/smc_config.yaml
```

### Analysis shows "NEUTRAL" for everything

**Possible causes:**
1. Not enough data (need 30+ bars)
2. Insufficient signals detected
3. Confidence thresholds too high

**Solution:**
- Lower thresholds in `config/smc_config.yaml`
- Use more timeframes
- Check data quality

---

## 🎓 Next Steps (After Basic Setup)

### 1. Tune Configuration (Optional)

Edit `config/smc_config.yaml` to adjust:
- Signal weights
- Confidence thresholds
- Timeframes
- Component parameters

### 2. Analyze Your Favorite Pairs

```python
from dashboard_smc import Dashboard

dashboard = Dashboard(symbols=["EURUSD", "GBPJPY", "XAUUSD"])
dashboard.run_full_cycle()
```

### 3. View Results

Check `smc_analysis_log.xlsx` for all historical analyses.

### 4. Customize

The system is modular - you can:
- Add new SMC detectors
- Adjust weights
- Add custom indicators
- Change reporting format
